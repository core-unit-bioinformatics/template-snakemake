# Memory limits
# First, the actual variables are set to None
# to indicate that the config info still needs
# to be parsed and turned into an integer.
# Reasoning:
# This is a design decision because the config
# settings here should be simple, i.e., consist
# essentially of value assignments. Parsing the
# potential suffix and converting the string into
# the appropriately scaled number/integer requires
# more complex logic that is implemented in the
# pyutils branch of the 'commons' modules. The pyutils
# will only be included later because they have
# many more dependencies to the parameters
# specified in the 'settings' branch. Hence, it is
# not reasonable to first include pyutils and then
# settings to realize the parsing/conversion right here.
